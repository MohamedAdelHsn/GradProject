I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick.

Mae Ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting.<br /><br />This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels, with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first I was eager to try. It has a shelf life of 2 years, and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator.<br /><br />The flavors of lemon grass, shallot, gingery galanga, kaffir lime peel, warm spices and red chili are very well balanced.

This helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste.<br /><br />For Thai curry, I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth, then add 3/4 Cup more broth per person, plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken, plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety.<br /><br />Mae Ploy's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip, salad dressing, or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through, (about 15-20 minutes at 325).<br /><br />The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and I would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price, without tedious preparation.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","New to Thai cuisine, I asked to try a milder curry, my tastes running to a maximum of medium heat.

I was so elated when I found out that Starbucks was now going to be in Keurig form, let alone this flavor.  I normally can not stand coffee with cream and sugar.  I enjoy my coffees, black, no cream or sugar, and STRONG.  This one is the lone exception.  Starbucks claims this is a medium roast.  Take it with a grain of salt.  It has a fantastic aroma but a bitter taste, with also a bit of an aftertaste.  The first time I had this at a Starbucks, I wanted to throw this out.  To be honest, it was nasty, but with the price of a Starbucks coffee, at their coffee shop, I refused to give in.  I added (2) packets of sugar, along with some half & half, and \"Oh my God\", I was in heaven.  I should say, this is for an 8oz cup.  Not only is this so good, it's actually my favorite coffee.<br /><br />Now with the K-Cup version... to make the equivalent, I select an 8oz brew, use half & half to where it's a medium brown, and (2) packets of Splenda.  Splenda, in coffee tastes as good as sugar.  I'm diabetic.

I recently began using Salmon in the pouch and really like how convenient it is to use and it taste great. The pouch is very easy to open just by tearing the top of the pouch which has a pre-made notch to initiate an easy opening. Once the pouch is open it is not resealable. The Salmon can be eaten directly out of the pouch or you can empty the contents to make a salad or other meal. I now keep some of these Salmon pouches at work and I carry a few in my every day carry (EDC) bag in case I get stuck somewhere and need a quick, easy, and healthy snack to keep me going. I also carry some when hiking, backpacking, or camping.<br /><br />The pouch is relatively strong and would not easily be punctured by an object. As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Salmon in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 70 calories with 20 calories from fat. Each serving contains 13 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product is skinless and boneless. This Salmon is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Salmon is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2 years from that date that I purchased the Salmon so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date. I have seen this product on sale at a local grocery store for under a dollar which is a great deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon Pouch to others.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon, 2.6oz pouches are a very convenient method of eating on the run or preparing a quick meal when time is short.

The pouch is very easy to open just by tearing the top of the pouch which has a pre-made notch to initiate an easy opening. Once the pouch is open it is not resealable. The Salmon can be eaten directly out of the pouch or you can empty the contents to make a salad or other meal. I now keep some of these Salmon pouches at work and I carry a few in my every day carry (EDC) bag in case I get stuck somewhere and need a quick, easy, and healthy snack to keep me going. I also carry some when hiking, backpacking, or camping.The pouch is relatively strong and would not easily be punctured by an object. As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Salmon in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 70 calories with 20 calories from fat. Each serving contains 13 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product is skinless and boneless. This Salmon is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Salmon is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2 years from that date that I purchased the Salmon so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date. I have seen this product on sale at a local grocery store for under a dollar which is a great deal.Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon Pouch to others.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","First of all, Chicken of the Sea's Pink Salmon tastes great and it is easy to use for a quick topping on a salad or at lunch.

The Stevia extract is supposed to be 200 to 400 times more intensely sweet than sugar. If that is the case why was dextrose used and why was it the more prevalent ingredient? I called the company on their 800 and asked this same question. The answer is (according to them) that dextrose is a carbohydrate derived from crushed corn. It is a filler in their product. The Rebiana is so intensely sweet that it was impractical to package it in its pure form in individual packets. The volume would be so small that consumers would wonder if anything was really there. To me this sounds plausible. I am not a dietician, a doctor nor do I work for the company. I simply use their product and like it.<br /><br />I hope this info is helpful.

And there's no question that eating these bars will make the trains run on time, so to speak.The problem is that not everyone tolerates inulin well, and tolerance is at different doses.  Some people experience gas, cramps, frequent bowel movements with tarry stool, and other kinds of GI distress.  This is not because of the increase in fiber per se -- it is a reaction to the specific fiber here, inulin.The bars are very sweet but don't treat them like a snack until you know how your body reacts.  (I read with horror the account of one person who sat down with a box and polished off four or five in a sitting.) Take it very very slowly.  I can tolerate one (1) bite of a bar a day; more than that and I get in trouble, period.  At one bite a day, this case of bars is lasting me a long, long time.  On the other hand, I'm not worried about the calories in the bar at that rate either.If you don't finish a bar you need to keep it in a baggie or container because it will dry out and become substantially less appealing.
